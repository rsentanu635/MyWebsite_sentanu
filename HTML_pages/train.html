                    <h2>How to train</h2>
                    <p>When training a scottish fold, like any pet, it is important to give them positive reinforcement, basic commands such as "sit," "come," or "stay." Consistency is also key when training your
                        scottish fold. Be sure to use the same commands and techniques during training. Another thing to note is to be sure if there are other people
                        in your household, that they use those same commands too when training your cat. Use their playtime as a form of training as well. Using toys or treats gives you and your cat
                        a fun way to encourage them into their newfound behavior they must learn and then be rewarded for. And last but not least, be patient with your scottish fold. As with any form of training any pet, be
                        sure to not get frustrated when they don't listen to your commands right away. Be sure to keep their training sessions short and a positive experience and gradually increase the duration as well as the difficulty.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>By using these practices of caring for your scottish fold, you are on your way to having a happy and healthy pet that loves you as much as you love it. Be sure to consult a professional cat trainer or behavioral specialist
                        if you have any trouble with your cat.
                    </p>
