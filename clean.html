                        <h2>How to clean</h2>
                        <p>Scottish folds are known to be very particular with their litter box space so be sure to clean it daily.
                            It is also important to be sure to trim their nails as well as cleaning behind their ears.
                        </p>
                        <h3>1. Cleaning their ears</h3>
                        <p>Along with gromming it is important to clean a scottish fold's ears since it is prone to infection.
                            Use a cotton ball moistened with their breed's specific ear cleaner and gently wipe the inside 
                            of their ear flap and ear canal, but don't insert the cotton ball too deep.
                        </p>
                        <h3>2. Trimming their nails</h3>
                        <p>Use a cat nail clipper to trim your cat's nails every few weeks. Also be careful not to cut too deep. A good rule of thumb to know is that 
                            the pink part of the nail contains the blood vessels and the nerves.
                        </p>
                        <h3>3. Bathing</h3>
                        <P>Scottish folds don't need frequent bathing but it is good practice to bathe them at least within 4 to 6 weeks. Use a cat-specific shampoo
                            and warm water to wet their fur, then lather the  shampoo and rinse thoroughly. Dry your cat with a towel or blow dryer on a low setting.
                        </P>
